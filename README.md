# Machine Learning Course - 42AI ðŸ¦¾

## Overview

This repository contains all the materials, exercises, and solutions from the week-long Machine Learning Bootcamp organized by 42AI, the Artificial Intelligence association of Ã‰cole 42. The bootcamp was designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning (ML), including foundational mathematics, implementation of ML algorithms, and practical applications. Participants worked through hands-on projects to build a strong understanding of machine learning principles.

## Contents

The bootcamp is divided into several modules, each focusing on key Machine Learning concepts and techniques. Below is an outline of the modules:

  - Introduction to Machine Learning
  - Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
  - Linear Algebra Review
    - Matrix operations
    - Transpose, addition, multiplication
  - Building a Regression Model
    - Hypothesis, cost function, and evaluation metrics
- **Key Exercises:**
  - Implementing a `Matrix` and `Vector` class with basic operations
  - Creating a basic statistical class, `TinyStatistician`, for computing mean, median, variance, and standard deviation

### Part 2: Univariate Linear Regression
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
  - Cost function minimization
  - Learning rate tuning
  - Normalization techniques
- **Key Exercises:**
  - Implementing gradient descent iteratively and using vectorization

### Part 3: Multivariate Linear Regression
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Extending regression models to handle multiple features
  - Polynomial regression for non-linear relationships
  - Feature scaling and engineering
  - Understanding overfitting and underfitting

  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  

**Key Exercises:**  
- Implementation of the sigmoid function and logistic hypothesis.  
- Building a logistic regression model using gradient descent.  
- Evaluating performance through classification metrics (confusion matrix, F1-score).  

### Part 5: Regularization  
**Topics Covered:**  
- Understanding Overfitting  
  - Causes and how to detect overfitting  
  - Concepts of regularization (L2 regularization)  
- Regularized Regression  
  - Regularized cost functions for linear and logistic regression  
  - Regularized gradient descent  

**Key Exercises:**  
- Implementing L2 regularization and applying it to regression models.  
- Extending linear and logistic regression to include regularization for better generalization.  
- Comparing regularized and non-regularized models to understand their impact on performance.
